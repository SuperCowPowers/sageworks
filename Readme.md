#### SageWorks: The scientist's workbench powered by AWS® for scalability, flexibility, and security.

SageWorks is a medium granularity framework that manages and aggregates AWS® Services into classes and concepts. When you use SageWorks you think about **DataSources**, **FeatureSets**, **Models**, and **Endpoints**. Underneath the hood those classes handle all the details around updating and managing a **complex set of AWS Services**. All the power and none of the pain so that your team can **Do Science Faster!**

## Why SageWorks?

<img align="right" src="docs/images/graph_representation.png" width="300">

- The AWS SageMaker® ecosystem is **awesome** but has a large number of services with significant complexity
- SageWorks provides **rapid prototyping** through easy to use **classes** and **transforms**
- SageWorks provides **visibility** and **transparency** into AWS SageMaker® Pipelines
    - What S3 data sources are getting pulled?
    - What Features Store/Group is the Model Using?
    - What's the ***Provenance*** of a Model in Model Registry?
    - What SageMaker Endpoints are associated with this model?


**Single pane of glass** visibility into the AWS Services that underpin the SageWorks Classes. We can see that SageWorks automatically tags and tracks the inputs of all artifacts providing 'data provenance' for all steps in the AWS modeling pipeline.

### SageWorks Zen
- The AWS SageMaker® set of services is vast and **complex**.
- SageWorks Classes encapsulate, organize, and manage sets of AWS® Services.
- **Heavy** transforms typically use **[AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)** or **[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)** (AWS Glue/EMR Serverless).
- **Light** transforms will typically use **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**.
- Heavy and Light transforms both update **AWS Artifacts** (collections of AWS Services).
- **Quick prototypes** are typically built with the **light path** and then flipped to the **heavy path** as the system matures and usage grows.

### Classes and Concepts
The SageWorks Classes are organized to work in concert with AWS Services. For more details on the current classes and class hierarchies see [SageWorks Classes and Concepts](docs/sageworks_classes_concepts.md).
