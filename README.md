## Why SageWorks?

- The Amazon SageMaker ecosystem has significant complexity
- SageWorks lets us set up ML Pipelines in a few lines of code
- **Pipeline Graphs:** Visibility/Transparency into our Pipelines
    - What S3 data sources are getting pulled?
    - What Features Store(s) is the Model Using?
    - What's the ***Provenance*** of a Model in Model Registry?
    - What SageMaker Endpoints are associated with this model?

<i><b> Clearly illustrated:</b> SageWorks uses Pipeline Graphs to provide intuitive and transparent visibility into AWS Sagemaker Deployments.</i>

## Installation
```
pip install sageworks
```

### SageWorks Zen

- SageWorks API reflects AWS ML Services through the lens of **Artifacts and Transforms**.
- [**AWS Glue**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/how-it-works.html) should maybe have been called '**AWS Spark**'
- **Heavy** transforms typically use **[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)** (via AWS Glue/Spark).
- **Light** transforms will typically use **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**.
- **Heavy** and **Light** transforms lead to **same** data/artifacts pushed in AWS Services.
- **Quick prototypes** can be built with the **light path** and then flipped to **heavy** as the system matures and usage grows.
- **Algorithms** have their own set of **Artifacts**:
  - Tables
  - Graphs
     - DAGs
     - Trees
