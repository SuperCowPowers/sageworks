## Why SageWorks?

- The Amazon SageMaker ecosystem has significant complexity
- SageWorks lets us set up ML Pipelines in a few lines of code
- **Pipeline Graphs:** Visibility/Transparency into our Pipelines
    - What S3 data sources are getting pulled?
    - What Features Store(s) is the Model Using?
    - What's the ***Provenance*** of a Model in Model Registry?
    - What SageMaker Endpoints are associated with this model?
