# Recent News
SageWorks is partnering with AWSÂ® to accelerate your Machine Learning Pipelines development with our new [Dashboard for ML Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-5idedc7uptbqo). Getting started with SageWorks is a snap and can be billed through AWS.

# Welcome to SageWorks
The SageWorks framework makes AWSÂ® both easier to use and more powerful. SageWorks handles all the details around updating and managing a complex set of AWS Services. With a simple-to-use Python API and a beautiful set of web interfaces, SageWorks makes creating AWS ML pipelines a snap. It also dramatically improves both the usability and visibility across the entire spectrum of services: Glue Job, Athena, Feature Store, Models, and Endpoints, SageWorks makes it easy to build production ready, AWS powered, machine learning pipelines.

## Private SaaS Architecture
*Secure your Data, Empower your ML Pipelines*

SageWorks is architected as a **Private SaaS** (also called BYOC: Bring Your Own Cloud). This hybrid architecture is the ultimate solution for businesses that prioritize data control and security. SageWorks deploys as an AWS Stack within your own cloud environment, ensuring compliance with stringent corporate and regulatory standards. It offers the flexibility to tailor solutions to your specific business needs through our comprehensive plugin support. By using SageWorks, you maintain absolute control over your data while benefiting from the power, security, and scalability of AWS cloud services.

### SageWorks Presentations
Even though SageWorks makes AWS easier, it's taking something very complex (the full set of AWS ML Pipelines/Services) and making it less complex. SageWorks has a depth and breadth of functionality so we've provided higher level conceptual documentation See: [SageWorks Presentations](https://supercowpowers.github.io/sageworks/presentations/)

### SageWorks Documentation

The SageWorks documentation [SageWorks Docs](https://supercowpowers.github.io/sageworks/) covers the Python API in depth and contains code examples. The documentation is fully searchable and fairly comprehensive.

The code examples are provided in the Github repo `examples/` directory. For a full code listing of any example please visit our [SageWorks Examples](https://github.com/SuperCowPowers/sageworks/blob/main/examples)
