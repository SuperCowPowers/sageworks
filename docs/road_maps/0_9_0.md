The SageWorks framework continues to 'flex' to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.


## General
**Streamlining**

We've learned a lot from our beta testers!

One of the important lessons is not to 'over manage' AWS. We want to provide useful, granular Classes and APIs. Getting out of the way is just as important as providing functionality. So **streamlining** will be a big part of our `0.9.0` roadmap.

**Caching**

Caching needs a substantial overhaul. Right now SageWorks over uses caching. We baked it into our AWSServiceBroker and that gets used by everything.

Caching only really makes sense when we can't wait for AWS to respond to requests. The Dashboard and Web Interfaces are the only use case where responsiveness is important. Other use cases like nightly batch processing and even scripts or notebooks, waiting for AWS is totally fine.

**Class/API Reductions**
The organic growth of SageWorks was based on user feedback and testing, that organic growth has led to an **abundance** of Classes and API calls. We'll be identifying classes and methods that are 'cruft' from some development push and will be deprecating those.
 
## Deprecation Warnings
We're starting to put in deprecation warning as we streamline classes and APIs. If you're using a class or method that's going to be deprecated you'll see a log message like this:

```
broker = AWSServiceBroker()
(deprecated_utils.py:28) WARNING AWSServiceBroker is deprecated and will be removed in version 0.9.
```

If you're using a class that's NOT going to be deprecated but currently uses/relies on one that is you'll still get a warning that you can ignore (developers will take care of it).

```
# This class is NOT deprecated but an internal class is
meta = Meta() 
(deprecated_utils.py:28) WARNING AWSServiceBroker is deprecated and will be removed in version 0.9.
```

In general these warning messages will be annoying but they will help us smoothly transistion and streamline our Classes and APIs.
