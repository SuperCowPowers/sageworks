# SageWorks Blogs
!!! tip inline end "Just Getting Started?"
    The SageWorks Blogs is a great way to see what's possible with SageWorks. Also if you're ready to jump in the [API Classes](../api_classes/overview.md) will give you details on the SageWorks ML Pipeline Classes.

## Latest Blogs

- **[AqSol Residual Analysis](residual_analysis.md):** In this Blog we'll look at the popular AqSol compound solubility dataset and walk backward through the ML pipeline by starting with model residuals and backtracking to the features and input data.

## Stupid yet Interesting

These blogs are odd corner cases that we stumbled into and discovered some interesting aspect of Cloud Platforms or ML Pipelines. 

- **[AWS Credentials Refresh Lock](aws_credentials_lock.md)** We discover that the AWS botocore library has a threading lock when refreshing credentials.
