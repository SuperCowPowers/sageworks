    The SuperCowPowers team is happy to give any assistance needed when setting up AWS and SageWorks. So please contact us at [sageworks@supercowpowers.com](mailto:sageworks@supercowpowers.com) or on chat us up on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WHAJuz8sw8) 

The SageWorks framework continues to 'flex' to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines. As part of this we're including CloudWatch log forwarding for any use of the SageWorks API (Dashboard, Glue, Lambda, Notebook, Laptop, etc).


### Functionality
The SageWorks logging setup includes the addition of a CloudWatch 'Handler' that forwards all log messages to the `SageWorksLogGroup`
