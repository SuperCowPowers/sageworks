# Data Algorithms

!!! tip inline end "Data Algorithms"
    WIP: These classes are currently actively being developed and are subject to change in both API and functionality over time. They provide a set of data algorithms for various types of data storage. We currently have subdirectorys for:
    
- **[DataFrames](dataframes/overview.md):** A set of algorithms that consume/return a Panda dataFrame.
- **[Graphs](graphs/overview.md):** Algorithms for node/edge graphs, specifically focused on NetworkX graphs.
- **[Spark](spark/overview.md):** A set of algorithms that consume/return a Spark dataFrame.
- **[SQL](sql/overview.md):** SQL queries that provide a wide range of functionality:

    - Outliers
    - Descriptive Stats
    - Correlations
    - and More
