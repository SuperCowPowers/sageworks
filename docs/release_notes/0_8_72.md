The SageWorks framework continues to flex to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.71` to `0.8.72`


## General
This release is an incremental release as part of the road map for `v.0.9.0`. Please see the full details of the planned changes here: [v0.9.0 Roadmap](../road_maps/0_9_0.md). 

### Artifact Hashes
For content verification purposes we've added a `hash()` method to all of the SageWorks Artifact classes (DataSource, FeatureSet, Model, Endpoint, Graph, etc). In addition to the new `hash()` method there is also the `modified()` method that will track the last time that data source got modifiied.

```
ds = DataSource("abalone_data")

ds.modified()
Out[2]: datetime.datetime(2024, 11, 17, 19, 45, 58, tzinfo=tzlocal())

ds.hash()
Out[3]: '622f5ddba9d4cad2cf642d1ea5555de9'

fs = FeatureSet("test_features")

fs.modified()
Out[4]: datetime.datetime(2024, 11, 21, 11, 30, 46, 228000, tzinfo=tzlocal())

fs.hash()
Out[5]: '1571eee207b72f14bd5065d6c4acdaaf'

```
**Note:** You will get a performance warning when running hash() as it typically involves a deeper computation on the data contents of that artifact.


## API Changes
- `get_database()` has a deprecation warning, it's replaced with just the `database` property.

    ```
    ds.get_database()
    <replaced by>
    ds.database
    ```

- Added the `hash()` method to Artifacts (see above).

## Internal Changes
TBD

Who doesn't like looking at code! Also +3 points for getting down this far! Here's a cow joke as a reward:
