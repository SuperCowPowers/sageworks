The SageWorks framework continues to flex to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.71` to `0.8.74`


## General
This release is an incremental release as part of the road map for `v.0.9.0`. Please see the full details of the planned changes here: [v0.9.0 Roadmap](../road_maps/0_9_0.md). 

### S3 based Plugins
We've added the ability to grab Dashboard plugins directly from an S3 bucket. Please see [Dashboard S3 Plugin](../admin/dashboard_s3_plugins.md)

### Fixed Refresh Credentials 'Hang'
The AWS credentials would get automatically refreshed each hour, but after 4 hours we were hitting an AWS 'refresh lock' that would lock up and never come back. That has been fixed, it will now properly give you a log message and throw an exception about needing to renew your `aws sso login` token/session.


## API Changes
**Plugins**
The directory that components were stored in was called 
`web_components` that has now been changed to just `components`.

**Web/View Import Changes**
If you're using one of the existing web view those have been changed to `web_interface.page_views`.

```
from sageworks.web_views.data_source_web_view import DataSourceWebView
from sageworks.web_interface.page_views.data_sources_page_view import DataSourcesPageView
```

More examples of how imports have changed

```
from sageworks.web_components import table
<has been changed to>
from sageworks.web_interface.components 
```

and

```
from sageworks.web_view.my_view
<has been changed to>
sageworks.web_interface.page_views.my_view
```
