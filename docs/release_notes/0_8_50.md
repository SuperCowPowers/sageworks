The SageWorks framework continues to flex to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.46` to `0.8.50`


## General
This release is an incremental release as part of the road map for `v.0.9.0`. Please see the full details of the planned changes here: [v0.9.0 Roadmap](../road_maps/0_9_0.md). 

### FeatureSet: id_column lock in
We're going to lock in id_columns when FeatureSets are created, AWS FeatureGroup requires an id column, so this is the best place to do it, see API Changes below.

### FeatureSet: Robust handling of training column
In the past we haven't supported giving a training column as input data. FeatureSets are read-only, so locking in the training rows is 'suboptimal'. In general you might want to use the FeatureSet for several models with different training/hold_out sets. Now if a FeatureSet detects a training column it will give the follow message:

```
Training column detected: Since FeatureSets are read only, SageWorks 
creates training views that can be dynamically changed. We'll use 
this training column to create a training view.
```

### Endpoint: auto_inference()
We're changing the internal logic for the `auto_inference()` method to include the id_column in it's output.

## API Changes
**FeatureSet**

When creating a FeatureSet the `id_column` is now a required argument.

```
ds = DataSource("test_data")
fs = ds.to_features("test_features", id_column="my_id") <-- Required
```

```
to_features = PandasToFeatures("my_feature_set")
to_features.set_input(df_features, id_column="my_id")  <-- Required
to_features.set_output_tags(["blah", "whatever"])
to_features.transform()
```
If you're data doesn't have a id column you can specify "auto"

```
to_features = PandasToFeatures("my_feature_set")
to_features.set_input(df_features, id_column="auto")  <-- Auto Id (index)
```

For more details see: [FeatureSet Class](../api_classes/feature_set.md)

The new Meta() API will be used inside of the Artifact classes (see Internal Changes...Artifacts... below)

## Improvements
**DFStore**

Robust handling of slashes, so now it will 'just work' with various upserts and gets:

	```
	# These all give you /ml/shap_value dataframe
	df_store.get("/ml/shap_values")
	df_store.get("ml/shap_values")
	df_store.get("//ml/shap_values")
	```


## Internal Changes
There's a whole new directory structure that helps isolate Cloud Platform specific funcitonality.

```
- sageworks/src
     - core/cloud_platform
        - aws
        - azure
        - gcp
```

- The `DFStore` now uses `AWSDFStore` as its concrete implementation class.
- Both `CachedMeta` and `AWSAccountClamp` have had a revamp of their singleton logic.

### Internal Caching
So as part of our [v0.9.0 Roadmap](../road_maps/0_9_0.md) we're continuing to revamp caching. We're experimenting with [CachedMeta Class](../cached/cached_meta.md) inside the Artifact classes. Caching continues to be challenging for the framework, it's an absolute must for Web Inferface/UI performance and then it needs to get out of the way for batch jobs and the concurrent building of ML pipelines.
