The SageWorks framework continues to 'flex' to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

### General
The AWSAccountClamp had too many responsibilities so that classes has been split up into two classes and a set of utilities:

- AWSAccountClamp
- AWSSession
- utils/execution_environment.py

### API Changes
- **Column Names**

	```
	data_source.column_names()
	feature_set.column_names()
	```
	is replaced with
	
	```
	data_source.columns
	feature_set.columns
   ```

- **Display/Training Views**

	```
	data_source.get_display_view()
	feature_set.get_display_view()
	feature_set.get_training_view()
	```
	is replaced with
	
	```
	data_source.view("display")
	feature_set.view("display")
	feature_set.view("training")
   ```

- **AWSAccountClamp**

	```
	AWSAccountClamp().boto_session()
	```
	is replaced with
	
	```
	AWSAccountClamp().boto3_session
   ```
- **All Classes**

    If the class previously had a `boto_session` attribute that has been renamed to `boto3_session`
 
 ### Glue Job Fixes
For `sageworks==0.8.8` you needed to be careful about when/where you set your config/ENV vars. With `0.8.9` you can now use the typical setup like this:

	```
	from sageworks.utils.config_manager import ConfigManager
	
	# Set the SageWorks Config
	cm = ConfigManager()
	cm.set_config("SAGEWORKS_BUCKET", args_dict["sageworks-bucket"])
	cm.set_config("REDIS_HOST", args_dict["redis-host"])
	```
