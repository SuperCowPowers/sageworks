The SageWorks framework continues to 'flex' to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.39` to `0.8.41`


## General
Just a small set of error handling and bug fixes.

## API Changes
**ParameterStore and DFStore**
For both of these classes we've changed the `add()` method to `upsert()` to better reflect what the functionality is actually doing (an **update** or **insert**).

```
df_store.add() --> df_store.upsert()
params.add() --> params.add()
```
