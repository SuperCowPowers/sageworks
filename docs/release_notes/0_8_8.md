    The SuperCowPowers team is happy to give any assistance needed when setting up AWS and SageWorks. So please contact us at [sageworks@supercowpowers.com](mailto:sageworks@supercowpowers.com) or on chat us up on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WHAJuz8sw8) 

The SageWorks framework continues to 'flex' to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

### Additional Functionality
- View Support (docs coming soon :)
- CloudWatch (docs coming soon :)

### API Changes
- **Auto Inference name change**

    When auto_inference is run on an endpoint the name of that inference run is currently `training_holdout`. That is too close to `model_training` and is confusing. So we're going to change the name to `auto_inference` which is way more explanatory and intuitive.
    
    **Porting plugins:** There should really not be any hard coding for `training_holdout`, plugins should just call `list_inference_runs()` (see below) and use the first one on the list.
    
- **`list_inference_runs()`**
    
    The `list_inference_runs()` method on Models has been improved. It now handles error states better (no model, no model training data) and will return 'model_training' LAST on the list, this should improve UX for plugin components.
    
   **Examples**
   
   ```
	model = Model("abalone-regression")
	model.list_inference_runs()
	Out[1]: ['auto_inference', 'model_training']
	
	model = Model("wine-classification")
	model.list_inference_runs()
	Out[2]: ['auto_inference', 'training_holdout', 'model_training']
	
	model = Model("aqsol-mol-regression")
    model.list_inference_runs()
	Out[3]: ['training_holdout', 'model_training']
	
	model = Model("empty-model-group")
	model.list_inference_runs()
	Out[4]: []
   ```
