!!!tip inline end "Need Help?"
    The SuperCowPowers team is happy to give any assistance needed when setting up AWS and SageWorks. So please contact us at [sageworks@supercowpowers.com](mailto:sageworks@supercowpowers.com) or on chat us up on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WHAJuz8sw8) 

The SageWorks framework continues to 'flex' to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

### Additional Functionality
- View Support (docs coming soon :)
- CloudWatch (docs coming soon :)

### API Changes
- **Auto Inference name change**

    When auto_inference is run on an endpoint the name of that inference run is currently `training_holdout`. That is too close to `model_training` and is confusing. So we're going to change the name to `auto_inference` which is way more explanatory and intuitive.
    
    **Porting plugins:** A global string replace of `training_holdout` â†’ `auto_inference` should be all it takes.
