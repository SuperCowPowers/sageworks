The SageWorks framework continues to flex to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.33` to `0.8.35`


### General
**SageWorks REPL:** The REPL now has a workaround for the current iPython embedded shell namespace scoping issue. See: [iPython Embedded Shell Scoping Issue](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/12199). So this pretty much means the REPL is 110% more **awesome** now!


### API Changes
None
	
### Improvements/Fixes
**AWS Service Broker:**
The AWS service broker was dramatic when it pulls meta data for something that just got deleted (or partially deleted), it was throwing CRITICAL log messages. We've refined the AWS error handling so that it's more granular about the error_codes for Validation or ResourceNotFound exceptions those are reduced to WARNINGS.

**ROCAUC modifications:** Version `0.8.33` put in quite a few changes, for `0.8.35` we've also added logic to both validate and ensure proper order of the probability columns with the class labels.

Who doesn't like looking at code! Also +3 points for getting down this far! Here's a cow joke as a reward:
