The SageWorks framework continues to flex to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.58` to `0.8.60`


## General
This release is an incremental release as part of the road map for `v.0.9.0`. Please see the full details of the planned changes here: [v0.9.0 Roadmap](../road_maps/0_9_0.md). 

### Custom Models
We've now exposed additional functionality and API around adding your own custom models. The new custom model support is documented on the [Features to Models](../core_classes/transforms/features_to_model.md) page.  


## API Changes
None

## Notes
Custom models introduce models that don't have model metrics or inference runs, so you'll see a lot of log messages complaining about not finding metrics or inference results, please just ignore those, we'll put in additional logic to address those cases.
