The SageWorks framework continues to flex to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.55` to `0.8.58`


## General
This release is an incremental release as part of the road map for `v.0.9.0`. Please see the full details of the planned changes here: [v0.9.0 Roadmap](../road_maps/0_9_0.md). 

### Caching Refactoring
We've created a new set of Cached Classes:

- CachedDataSource
- CachedFeatureSet
- CachedModel
- CacheEndpoint

As part of this there's now a `sageworks/cached` directory that housed these classes and the `CachedMeta` class.

## API Changes
**Meta Imports**
Yes, this changed AGAIN :)

```
from sageworks.meta import Meta
<change to>
from sageworks.api import Meta
```

**CachedModel Import**
```
from sageworks.api import CachedModel
<change to>
from sageworks.cached.cached_model import CachedModel
```
For more details see: [CachedModel](../cached/cached_model.md)


## Improvements
**Dashboard Responsiveness**

The whole point of these Cached Classes is to improve Dashboard/Web Interface responsiveness. The Dashboard uses both the CachedMeta and Cached(Artifact) classes to make both overview and drilldowns faster.

**Supporting a Client Use Case**
There was a use case where a set of plugin pages needed to iterate over all the models to gather and aggregate information. We've supported that use case with a new decorator that avoids overloading AWS/Throttling issues.


**Internal**
The Dashboard now refreshes all data every 90 seconds, so if you don't see you're new model on the dashboard... just wait longer. :)
