The SageWorks framework continues to 'flex' to support different real world use cases when operating a set of production machine learning pipelines.

**Note:** These release notes cover the changes from `0.8.22` to `0.8.23`


### General
Mostly bug fixes and minor API changes.

### API Changes

- **Removing `auto_one_hot` arg from `PandasToFeatures` and `DataSource.to_features()`**
    
    When creating a `PandasToFeatures` object or using `DataSource.to_features()` there was an optional argument `auto_one_hot`. This would try to automatically convert object/string columns to be one-hot encoded. In general this was only useful for 'toy' datasets but for more complex data we need to specify exactly which columns we want converted.
  
- **Adding optional `one_hot_columns` arg to `PandasToFeatures.set_input()` and `DataSource.to_features()`**  
    
    When calling either of these FeatureSet creation methods you can now add an option arg `one_hot_columns` as a list of columns that you would like to be one-hot encoded.
