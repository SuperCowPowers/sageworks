### General
The View classes have finished their initial refactoring. The 'read' class `View()` can be constructed either directly or with the `ds/fs.view("display")` methods. See [Views](../api_classes/views.md) for more details. There also a set of classes for constructing views, please see [View Overview](../core_classes/views/overview.md)

### API Changes

- **Table Name attribute**
    
    The `table_name` attribute/property has been replaced with just `table`

	```
	ds.table_name -> ds.table
	fs.table_name -> fs.table
	view.table_name -> view.table
	```
