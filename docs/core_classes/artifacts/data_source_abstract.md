# DataSource Abstract

!!! tip inline end "API Classes"
    Found a method here you want to use? The [API Classes](../../api_classes/overview.md) have method pass-through so just call the method on the DataSource API Class and voil√† it works the same.

The DataSource Abstract class is a base/abstract class that defines API implemented by all the child classes (currently just AthenaSource but later RDSSource, FutureThing ).
