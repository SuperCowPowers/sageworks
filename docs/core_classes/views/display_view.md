# Display View

!!! warning inline end "Experimental"
    The Workbench View classes are currently in experimental mode so have fun but expect issues and API changes going forward.
    
**Note:** This class will be used in the future to fine tune what columns get displayed. For now just use the DataSource/FeatureSet `set_computation_columns()` [DataSource](../artifacts/athena_source.md) or [FeatureSet](../artifacts/feature_set_core.md)
