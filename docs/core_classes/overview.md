# Core Classes

!!! warning "The SageWorks Core Classes provide more control but are more complex"
    These classes interact with many of the AWS service details. They try to balance usablility while maintaining a level of control and refinement over the AWS ML Pipline. For user oriented classes please see [SageWorks API Classes](../api_classes/overview.md)

Welcome to the SageWorks Core Classes

These class provide low-level APIs for the SageWorks package, these classes directly interface with the AWS Sagemaker Pipeline interfaces and have a large number of methods with some complexity.
