The SageWorks Dashboard can be customized extensively. Using SageWorks **Themes** allows you to customize the User Interfaces to suit your preferences, including completely customized color palettes and fonts. We offer a set of default 'dark' and 'light' themes, but we'll also customize the theme to match your company's color palette and logos.
