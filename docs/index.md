# Welcome to SageWorks
SageWorks is a medium granularity framework that manages and aggregates AWSÂ® Services into classes and concepts. When you use SageWorks you think about DataSources, FeatureSets, Models, and Endpoints. Underneath the hood those classes handle all the details around updating and managing a complex set of AWS Services.
